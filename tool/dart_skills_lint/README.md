## Overview

An **Agent Skill** is a portable, self-contained directory that extends an AI agent's capabilities. Pre-submit linting ensures that your skill definitions are valid and ready for consumption by agent platforms.

`dart_skills_lint` validates:
- Presence of mandatory `SKILL.md` file.
- YAML frontmatter constraints (naming, length, etc.).
- Directory structure (flat, no deep nesting).
- Relative path integrity.

For a full definition of the skill standard, see the [Agent Skills Specification](documentation/knowledge/SPECIFICATION.md).

## Installation

`dart_skills_lint` ships as both a standalone native binary (no Dart
SDK required) and as a Dart package on pub.dev. Pick the path that
matches your environment.

> **Homebrew note.** A `brew install dart-skills-lint` path is on the
> roadmap; it will land after `dart_skills_lint` migrates to its own
> dedicated repository. Until then, the install paths below cover all
> supported platforms.

### 1. Dart developers — pub.dev

If you already have the Dart SDK installed, the standard pub.dev paths
still work and are unchanged.

#### As a project dev_dependency

Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  dart_skills_lint: ^0.5.0
```

Then:
```bash
dart pub get
```

#### Globally activated

For multiple projects without per-project pubspec entries:
```bash
dart pub global activate dart_skills_lint
```

### 2. `install.sh` — Linux + macOS, no Dart required

The recommended path for CI runners and laptops without the Dart SDK
on PATH. Downloads the matching prebuilt binary from the latest GitHub
Release, verifies its SHA256, and installs to `/usr/local/bin` (with a
`sudo` fallback). Supports macOS arm64 + x64 and Linux x64 + arm64.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/google/skills_lint.dart/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

Optional env vars (set before the `bash` part):
- `INSTALL_DIR` — install destination (default `/usr/local/bin`).
- `VERSION` — pin a specific release like `0.4.0` (default `latest`).
- `REPO` — alternate source repo (default `flutter/agent-plugins`).

#### macOS first-launch note

macOS binaries are not yet code-signed. The first time you run the
binary, macOS Gatekeeper will block it ("cannot be opened because the
developer cannot be verified"). Remove the quarantine flag once:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "$(which dart_skills_lint)"
```

This step goes away once notarized builds ship.

### 3. Direct download — Linux + macOS, no install script

For environments where piping a script to `bash` isn't acceptable.
Grab the tarball for your platform from
[the latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/google/skills_lint.dart/releases/latest)
and verify its SHA256 against the release's `SHA256SUMS` asset.

```bash
TARGET="linux-x64"     # or: macos-arm64, macos-x64, linux-arm64
VERSION="0.5.0"
BASE="https://github.com/google/skills_lint.dart/releases/download/dart_skills_lint-v${VERSION}"
curl -fsSLO "${BASE}/dart_skills_lint-${TARGET}.tar.gz"
curl -fsSLO "${BASE}/SHA256SUMS"
grep " dart_skills_lint-${TARGET}.tar.gz$" SHA256SUMS | sha256sum -c -
tar -xzf "dart_skills_lint-${TARGET}.tar.gz"
sudo install -m 0755 "dart_skills_lint-${TARGET}" /usr/local/bin/dart_skills_lint
```

On macOS, replace `sha256sum -c -` with `shasum -a 256 -c -`.

## Usage

`dart_skills_lint` runs as a command-line tool, configured by flags or by
a `dart_skills_lint.yaml` file. The CLI is the user-facing surface; it
also has a programmatic API for contributors who need to embed the
linter in their own test suite — see
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md#embedding-the-linter-in-tests).

### 1. As a Command Line Tool with Arguments
Run the linter against your skills or root skills directories by passing arguments.

```bash
dart run dart_skills_lint --skills-directory ./path/to/skills-root
```

Multiple root directories can be specified:
```bash
dart run dart_skills_lint --skills-directory ./path/to/root-a --skills-directory ./path/to/root-b
```

Validate Individual Skills directly using `--skill` or `-s`:
```bash
dart run dart_skills_lint --skill ./path/to/my-single-skill
```

If no directory is specified, it automatically checks `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills` relative to your workspace root.

### Flags
- `-d`, `--skills-directory`: Specifies a root directory containing sub-folders of skills to validate. Can be passed multiple times. Can use home tilde expansion (ex: `~/.agents/skills`).
- `-s`, `--skill`: Specifies an individual skill directory to validate directly. Can be passed multiple times.
- `-q`, `--quiet`: Hide non-error validation output.
- `-w`, `--print-warnings`: Enable printing of warning messages.
- `--fast-fail`: Halt execution immediately on the error.
- `--ignore-config`: Ignore the YAML configuration file entirely.
- `--[no-]check-trailing-whitespace`: Enable/disable checking for trailing whitespace. (Disabled by default).
- `--fix`: Write fixes for failing lints to disk.
- `--dry-run`: When combined with `--fix`, prints the proposed diff without writing.
- `--fix-apply`: *Deprecated* alias for `--fix`. Prints a deprecation notice on use.

### 2. As a Command Line Tool with a YAML Configuration File
You can configure the linter using a configuration file (defaulting to `dart_skills_lint.yaml` in the current directory).

Create `dart_skills_lint.yaml` in the root of your repository:

```yaml
# dart_skills_lint.yaml
dart_skills_lint:
  rules:
    check-relative-paths: error
    check-absolute-paths: error
  directories:
    - path: "~/.agents/skills"
      ignore_file: "~/.agents/skills/ignore.json"
  individual_skills:
    - path: "my_custom_standalone_skill"
      rules:
        missing_install_script: warning
      ignore_file: "my_ignores.json"
```

Then you can simply run:
```bash
dart run dart_skills_lint
```

### Rule Precedence

When resolving which severity and parameters to apply for a rule, `dart_skills_lint` evaluates settings in the following order of precedence (highest to lowest):

1. **CLI Flags / API Overrides**:
   - Rule severity overrides: Explicit flags passed to the CLI (e.g., `--check-trailing-whitespace` or `--no-check-trailing-whitespace`).
   - Rule parameter overrides: Namespaced command-line parameter flags (e.g., `--path-does-not-exist-exclude=".*-workspace"`). Passing an empty string (e.g. `--path-does-not-exist-exclude=""`) explicitly clears the custom parameter.
2. **Path-Specific Config**: Rules defined under `directories:` or `individual_skills:` in `dart_skills_lint.yaml` for a matching path.
   - If a target config specifies a **map** (e.g. `path-does-not-exist: { severity: error, exclude: "..." }`), the parameters map completely overrides any global parameters for that rule.
   - If a target config specifies a **simple string** severity (e.g. `path-does-not-exist: error`), the severity is overridden, but the global parameters map is inherited/preserved.
3. **Global Config**: Rules and parameters defined under the top-level `rules:` in `dart_skills_lint.yaml`.
4. **Defaults**: The hardcoded defaults for each rule.

This ensures that you can always override configuration file settings for a specific run by using CLI flags.

### 3. Custom Rules

Custom rule authoring lives in the
[`dart-skills-lint-validation`](skills/dart-skills-lint-validation/SKILL.md)
skill — that skill walks through extending `SkillRule` and passing the
rule into the linter.

## Specification Validation

The linter checks each skill against the spec at
[`documentation/knowledge/SPECIFICATION.md`](documentation/knowledge/SPECIFICATION.md).
For the full list of built-in rules — default severities, exact
diagnostic shapes, auto-fix behavior, and how to disable each — see
[`RULES.md`](RULES.md).

## Recipes

Drop-in snippets for the two most common ways to wire `dart_skills_lint`
into a project's quality gates. Each recipe is exercised by
[`test/recipe_drift_test.dart`](test/recipe_drift_test.dart), so if a
flag here goes stale, CI fails.

### Recipe: GitHub Actions

Save the following as `.github/workflows/lint-skills.yml`. It runs on
every push and PR, installs `dart_skills_lint` globally on the runner,
and validates every skill under `.claude/skills/`. Adjust the path to
match where your skills live.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/lint-skills.yml
name: Lint Agent Skills
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

permissions: read-all

jobs:
  lint-skills:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7.0.1
      - uses: dart-lang/setup-dart@v1
      - run: dart pub global activate dart_skills_lint
      - run: dart pub global run dart_skills_lint --skills-directory ./.claude/skills
```

To validate a single skill directory instead, swap the last step:

```yaml
      - run: dart pub global run dart_skills_lint --skill ./.claude/skills/my-skill
```

### Recipe: Dart-native pre-commit hook

A pre-commit hook that calls into the linter directly — no Husky, no
Python `pre-commit` framework, just Dart and the existing
`dart pub global` tooling.

Activate the linter once per machine:

```bash
dart pub global activate dart_skills_lint
```

Then install the hook into the repository (run from the repo root):

```bash
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit <<'HOOK'
#!/bin/sh
set -e
# Lint every skill under .claude/skills before each commit.
# Add --skill arguments for other locations as needed.
exec dart pub global run dart_skills_lint --skills-directory ./.claude/skills --quiet
HOOK
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

The hook exits non-zero on lint failure, blocking the commit. To
auto-apply fixable lints inside the hook, append `--fix` to the linter
invocation.

### Recipe: have an agent set it up for you

If you're using Claude Code, Gemini, or another agent that can read
repository-local skills, paste the following prompt to have the agent
install and validate `dart_skills_lint` for you. The agent will
follow the
[`dart-skills-lint-setup`](skills/dart-skills-lint-setup/SKILL.md)
skill for first-time wiring, then the
[`dart-skills-lint-validation`](skills/dart-skills-lint-validation/SKILL.md)
skill to run the linter and resolve any failures.

> Set up dart_skills_lint in this project. Use the skill at
> `skills/dart-skills-lint-setup/SKILL.md`
> to add it as a dev_dependency, create the configuration file,
> and wire it into CI. Then use the skill at
> `skills/dart-skills-lint-validation/SKILL.md`
> to run the linter and resolve any failures.
